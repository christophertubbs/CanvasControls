# CanvasControls
Form controls for HTML canvases

Basically, the idea is to implement form controls, like those found in winforms, within an HTML context, most likely through a canvas. The idea is that this *might* (***might***) offer better performance for large editors where DOM traversal and editing would end up becoming a problem.

## Required controls

- [ ] Text Box
- [ ] Text Area
- [ ] Number Box
- [ ] Check Box
- [ ] Text Block
- [ ] Field Set
- [ ] Button
- [ ] Date/Time selector
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Tree

Some sort of layout tools (json maybe?) will also be important.
